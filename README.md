3. **Multi-Task Learning with Segmentation and Edge Detection:**
   - The model performs multi-task learning by incorporating segmentation and edge detection tasks in the decoder's top layer outputs.

4. **Post-processing with Conditional Random Field (CRF):**
   - The segmentation results are refined using Conditional Random Field for improved segmentation boundary delineation.

## Usage

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Download the datasets from the provided Baidu Netdisk link.
2. **Model Training**: Refer to the code provided in the respective directories (`The code of Landslide segmentation` and `The code of Landslide recognition`) for model training.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the models on the desired dataset and analyze the results in the `The running results of each model under the three data sets` directory.

## Results

The performance of the models can be evaluated using metrics such as IoU, Dice coefficient, Overall Accuracy (OA), and Cohenâ€™s kappa coefficient. Compare the results with traditional image segmentation models like Unet, FCN, and Segnet.
